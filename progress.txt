to do: make sure things can be clicked/refreshed/etc with no data present
if thigns are null - sometimes need to hide things

//check if sections are completed
//maybe can have each section check itself, and pass that back to the create component obj



createParent {

const [completedSections, setCompletedSections] = useState({
    photo: false,
    profile: false,
    workexperience: false,
    education: false,
    skills: false,
    contact: false
})

const updateCompletedSection = (key) => {
    setCompletedSections((prevState) => {
        return {...prevState, }
    })
}

}
