## Lessons Learned

This is the second iteration of what was my very first React project. I learned a lot about basic React hooks, controlling forms, responsive design, and a lot more. I also learned how to read and write to localstorage. In the future I plan to rebuild it using an authentication service and cloud database as well as provide more templates to choose from.
